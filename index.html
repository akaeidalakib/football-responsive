                        Founded in 1960 as the capital of Brazil and located in the middle of the country, Brasilia may

                        have a long history but the city is like an open-air museum. The capital was planned and
                        developed
                        by iconic architects Oscar Niemeyer and Lúcio Costa and is filled with fine works by these great
                        figures.

                        While the city isn’t the permanent home to any club, Brasilia is proud to have the impressive
                        Mané
                        Garrincha Stadium which was recently renovated to host the 2014 World Cup.
